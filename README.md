# Helmet-Detection-Yolov8
Detection of helmet using custom data from Yolov8.

## Yolov8
One of the key innovations in YOLOv8 is its use of anchor-free detection. This means that YOLOv8 does not need to pre-define anchor boxes, which can be a complex and time-consuming process. Instead, YOLOv8 predicts the center of an object directly, which leads to faster and more accurate detections.
